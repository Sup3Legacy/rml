<p>
Now to replace this point moing left to right, we define behavior of a
point going up and down.
</p>
<p><pre class="code">
let process up_down state =
  for i = 1 to 50 do emit state.vel (0., 2.); pause done;
  loop
    for i = 1 to 100 do emit state.vel (0., - 2.); pause done;
    for i = 1 to 100 do emit state.vel (0., 2.); pause done
  end
</pre></p>
<p>
A point going up and down is thus defined as follows.
</p>
<p><pre class="code">
let process moving_point' state =
   run (up_down state) ||
   run (compute_pos state) || run (draw state)
</pre></p>

<p>
To reconfigure the previous point, we only have to send this process on the signal <code>new_behavior</code>.
</p>
<p><pre class="code">
emit new_behavior moving_point';;
</pre></p>
<p>
We can restore the previous behavior.
</p>
<p><pre class="code">
emit new_behavior moving_point;;
</pre></p>

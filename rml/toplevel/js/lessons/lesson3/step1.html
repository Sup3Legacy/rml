<p>
In this lesson, we show how we can add and remove processes to a
system during its execution. To illustrate that, we will use a simple
graphical application which displays a moving point.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, we define the state of a moving point by a record which
contains the color of the point, and two signals that represent
respectively the flows of positions and velocities of the point.
</p>
<p><pre class="code">
type state =
    { color: Graphics.color;
      pos: (float * float, float * float) event;
      vel: (float * float, float * float) event; }
</pre></p>
<p>
At each instant, the position and velocity of a point are represented
by a pair of floats.

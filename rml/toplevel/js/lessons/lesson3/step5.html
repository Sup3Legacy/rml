The behavior of a moving point is the parallel composition of the
three preceding processes.
</p>
<p><pre class="code">
let process moving_point state =
   run (compute_pos state)
   ||
   run (left_right state)
   ||
   run (draw state)
</pre></p>
<p><pre class="code">
#run moving_point (new_state ());;
</pre></p>

<p>
The created process can not be removed form the execution since it do
not terminate. In the next step, we will see how to implement a simple
process manager that can remove stop the execution of a process in a
modular way.

To use this process, we need a signal on which we can send and receive
a process. In case of multiple emission during the same instant, we
build the parallel composition of the sent processes.
</p>
<p><pre class="code">
signal new_behavior
  default (fun state -> process ())
  gather (fun p q state ->
            process (run (p state) || run (q state)))
;;
</pre></p>
<p>
Now we can execute a moving point whose behavior can be replaced
dynamically.
</p>
<p><pre class="code">
#run replace moving_point (new_state ()) new_behavior;;
</pre></p>

Let see now how we can change the behavior of a process. We define a
process <code>replace</code> which takes as argument an initial
behavior <code>p_init</code>, a state <code>state</code> and a
signal <code>new_behavior</code> on which a new behavior that must
replace the current behavior can be sent.
</p>
<p><pre class="code">
let rec process replace p_init state new_behavior =
  do
    run (p_init state)
  until new_behavior(p) ->
    run (replace p state new_behavior)
  done
</pre></p>
<p>
The process <code>p_init</code> parametrized by <code>state</code> is
executed under the control of the
signal <code>new_behavior</code>. When <code>new_behavior</code> is
emitted, <code>p_init</code> is stopped and we get the
process <code>p</code> carried on this signal. The new
process <code>p</code> is executed through the recursive call
to <code>replace</code>. It allows to change again the behavior of the
process.

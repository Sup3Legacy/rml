<p>
To compute the position of the point, we integreate the velocity.
</p>
<p><pre class="code">
let process compute_pos state =
  loop
    let p = last ?state.pos +: last ?state.vel in
    emit state.pos p;
    pause
  end
</pre></p>

<p>
So, to move a point from left to right, we define a process which
change the velocity of a point at each instant as follows.
</p>
<p><pre class="code">
let process left_right state =
  loop emit state.vel (2.0, 0.); pause end
</pre></p>

<p>
To observe the position of a point, we define a
process <code>draw</code> which emits the state of a point at each
instant.
</p>
<p><pre class="code">
let process draw state =
  loop
    emit to_draw state; pause
  end
</pre></p>

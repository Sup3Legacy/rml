<h3>Parallel composition</h3>

<p>The notion of instant is really illustrated when parallel
computations occurs. The parallel execution of two expressions is
denoted [e1 || e2]. It guaranties that the two expressions are
executed at each instant.</p>

<p class="code"><code>let process ex1 =
  run (non_instantaneous_loop 10) || run (non_instantaneous_loop 10) ;;</code></p>

<p class="code"><code>#run ex1;;</code></p>

<p>In the previous example ([ex1]), we can observe that each instance
of the process [non_instantaneous_loop] prints one number per
instant. In the following example, the function [instantaneous_loop]
is executed in one instant.</p>

<p class="code"><code>let process ex2 =
  run (non_instantaneous_loop 10) || instantaneous_loop 10 ;;</code></p>

<p class="code"><code>#run ex2;;</code></p>

<h3>Valued events</h3>

<p>Events can carry values. When the signal is declared, the
programmer can specify how values that are emitted during the same
instant are combined (the default behavior is to collect all the
values into a list.).</p>

<p>Here, we define a signal [s] which sums the values it receives
during an instant.</p>

<p><code>signal s default 0 gather (+);;</code></p>
<br />

<p>To get the value of a signal, we can use the constructs [await s(x)
in e] which waits that [s] is emitted and then executes [e] where [x]
get the value carried by the signal [s].</p>

<p><code>let process print_s =
  loop
    await s(x) in
    print_int x;
    print_newline ()
  end
;;</code></p>
<br />

<p><code>#run print_s;;</code></p>
<br />

<p><code>emit s 1;;</code></p>
<br />

<p><code>emit s 2;;</code></p>
<br />

<p><code>emit s 3; emit s 4;;</code></p>
<br />

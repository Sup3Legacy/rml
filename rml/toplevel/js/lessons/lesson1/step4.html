<h3>Parallel composition</h3>

<p>
The notion of instant becomes really visible when parallel
computations occurs. The parallel execution of two expressions is
denoted <code>e1 || e2</code> (the boolean disjuction is
denoted <code>e1 or e2</code>). It guarantees that the two expressions
are executed at each instant.
</p>

<p><pre class="code">
#exec (   run (non_instantaneous_loop 10)
       || run (non_instantaneous_loop 10) );;
</pre></p>

<p>
In the previous example, we can observe that each instance of the
process <code>non_instantaneous_loop</code> prints one number per
instant. In the following example, the
function <code>instantaneous_loop</code> is executed in one instant
(since it is not a process, there is no <code>run</code> to apply it).
</p>
<p><pre class="code">
#exec (   run (non_instantaneous_loop 10)
       || instantaneous_loop 10 );;
</pre></p>
<p>
We can observe now that when <code>instantaneous_loop</code> starts
its execution it do not step before it terminates.

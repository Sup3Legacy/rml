<h3>Parallel composition</h3>

<p>The notion of instant is really illustrated when parallel
computations occurs. The parallel execution of two expressions is
denoted <code>e1 || e2</code>. It guaranties that the two expressions are
executed at each instant.</p>

<p><pre class="code">let process ex1 =
    run (non_instantaneous_loop 10)
 || run (non_instantaneous_loop 10) ;;</pre></p>

<p><pre class="code">#run ex1;;</pre></p>

<p>In the previous example (<code>ex1</code>), we can observe that each instance
of the process <code>non_instantaneous_loop</code> prints one number per
instant. In the following example, the function <code>instantaneous_loop</code>
is executed in one instant.</p>

<p><pre class="code">let process ex2 =
  run (non_instantaneous_loop 10) || instantaneous_loop 10 ;;</pre></p>

<p><pre class="code">#run ex2;;</pre></p>

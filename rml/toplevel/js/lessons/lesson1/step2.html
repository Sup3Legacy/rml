<h3>Logical time</h3>

<p>ReactiveML is based on the synchronous model. In this model, time
is a succession of instants. Any OCaml function is considered to be
instantaneous.</p>

<p class="code"><code>let instantaneous_loop n =
  for i = 1 to n do
    print_int i;
    print_newline ()
  done ;;</code></p>

<p class="code"><code>instantaneous_loop 10;;</code></p>

<p>Functions that can be executed through several instants are
processes. The [pause] statement waits for the end of instant.</p>

<p class="code"><code>let process non_instantaneous_loop n =
  for i = 1 to n do
    print_int i;
    print_newline ();
    pause
  done ;;</code></p>

<p class="code"><code>#run (non_instantaneous_loop 10);;</code></p>

<p>Remark: You can use the button "suspend" (or use the directive
[#suspend;;]) to execute the program in a step by step mode. The to
return into the sampled mode you can use the button "resume" (or the
directive [#resume;;]).</p>

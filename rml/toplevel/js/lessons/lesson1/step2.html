<h3>Logical time and parallel composition</h3>

<p>ReactiveML is based on the synchronous model. In this model, time
is a succession of instants. Any OCaml function is considered to be
instantaneous.</p>

<p><code>let instantaneous_loop n =
  for i = 1 to n do
    print_int i;
    print_newline ()
  done
;;</code></p>
<br />

<p><code>instantaneous_loop 10;;</code></p>
<br />

<p>Functions that can be executed through several instants are
processes. The [pause] statement waits for the end of instant.</p>

<p><code>let process non_instantaneous_loop n =
  for i = 1 to n do
    print_int i;
    print_newline ();
    pause
  done
;;</code></p>
<br />

<p><code>#run (non_instantaneous_loop 10);;</code></p>
<br />

<p>The notion of instant is really illustrated when parallel
computations occurs. The parallel execution of two expressions is
denoted [e1 || e2]. It guaranties that the two expressions are
executed at each instant.</p>

<p><code>let process ex1 =
  run (non_instantaneous_loop 10) || run (non_instantaneous_loop 10)
;;</code></p>
<br />

<p><code>#run ex1;;</code></p>
<br />

<p>In the previous example ([ex1]), we can observe that each instance
of the process [non_instantaneous_loop] prints one number per
instant. In the following example, the function [instantaneous_loop]
is executed in one instant.</p>

<p><code>let process ex2 =
  run (non_instantaneous_loop 10) || instantaneous_loop 10
;;</code></p>
<br />

<p><code>#run ex2;;</code></p>
<br />

<p>Remark: You can use the button "suspend" (or use the directive
[#suspend;;]) to execute the program in a step by step mode. The to
return into the sampled mode you can use the button "resume" (or the
directive [#resume;;]).</p>

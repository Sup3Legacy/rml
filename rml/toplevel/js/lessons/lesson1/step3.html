<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>The communication between parallel processes is made through events
that are broadcasted instantaneously. Hence, an event is present
during the instant where it is broadcasted, otherwise it is
absent.</p>

<p>An event is declare with the construct [signal].</p>

<p class="code"><code>signal s;;</code></p>

<p>The construct [await s] waits the next instant where s is
broadcasted.</p>

<p class="code"><code>let process p =
  await s;
  print_endline "Hello!" ;;</code></p>

<p class="code"><code>#run p;;</code></p>

<p>An event is broadcasted using [emit].</p>

<p class="code"><code>emit s;;</code></p>

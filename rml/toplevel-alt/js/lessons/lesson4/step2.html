<p>
Now, we can implement the three states automaton using three mutually
recurssive processes, one for each state.
</p>

<p>
The structure of a process modeling a state of an automaton is always
the following:
</p>

<p><pre class="code">
let rec process state1 t1 t2 = 
  do 
    halt (* Could be any process *)
  until 
  | t1 -> run state1 (* Could be any state*)
  | t2 -> run state1
  done
</pre></p>

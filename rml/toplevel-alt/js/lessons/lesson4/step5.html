In this example, time will be only logical to avoid interactions with
the operating system. To see how logical time can be linked to
physical time, the interested reader can find details in
the <a href="http://reactiveml.org/reactive_asco">Reactive Asco
example</a>.

<p>
First, we need a process that waits for a given
duration <code>d</code> expressed in a number of logical steps greater
or equal to one.
</p>

<p><pre class="code">
let process sleep d =
  for i = 1 to d do
    pause;
  done
  || pause
</pre></p>

<p>
Using this process, we can define the ring tone, a process that
periodically prints <code>Bip Bip Bip Bip</code> on the standard
output.
</p>

<p><pre class="code">
let process bipbipbipbip =
     loop
       for i = 1 to 4 do
         print_string "Bip "; flush stdout;
         run sleep 10;
       done;
       run sleep 100;
       print_newline ()
      end
</pre></p>

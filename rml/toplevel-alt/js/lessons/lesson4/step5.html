First we need a process that wait for a given duration expressed in
number of logical steps.
</p>

<p><pre class="code">
let process sleep d = 
  for i = 1 to d do
    pause;
  done;;
</p></pre>

<p>
Then lets define the clock control signals,
</p>

<p><pre class="code">
signal ck_off, ck_bip, ck_snooze;;
signal ck_arm default 0 gather (fun x y -> x);;
</p></pre>

<p>
Note that signal <code>ck_arm</code> carry a value. This value will be
used to set up the countdown of the alarm. On the other hand, when the
snooze button is hit, the duration of the countdown is fixed. Hence
signal <code>ck_snooze</code> does not need to carry a value.

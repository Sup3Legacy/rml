In this lesson, we use automata to implement a simple alarm-clock
</p>

<p>
The controller of an alarm-clock can be described by a three-states automaton.
<ul>
<li> Idle: no alarm is set; </li>
<li> Armed: waiting for the deadline; </li>
<li> Bipbipip: the clock is ringing.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Lets start with a very simple process that wait for a duration
expressed in number of logical steps.
</p>

<p><pre class="code">
let process sleep d = 
  for i = 1 to d do
    pause;
  done
</pre></p>

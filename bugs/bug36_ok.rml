There seems to be  a bug with it in an Rml  program: I assume this comes
from a parenthesis problem in the generated OCaml code.

type t =
  | Empty
  | Node of int * t * t
;;

let rec something = function
  | Empty -> 0
  | Node (a, (Node _ as left), _) -> something left
  | Node (a, _, _) -> a
;;
